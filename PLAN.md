# Project Plan

## Introduction

This document outlines the structured plan for the development of **["Quote of the Day"]** web page.  
The purpose of this plan is to provide a clear roadmap from idea conception to implementation, ensuring that the project is built with clarity, scalability, and user experience in mind.

By documenting the problem, defining the minimum viable product (MVP), and considering both immediate and future requirements, this plan will serve as a guide for development, collaboration, and decision-making throughout the project lifecycle.

## 1. Problem Statement

Life presents different moods and challenges each day.  
Some individuals wake up struggling to find the energy to face the day, while others feel weighed down by personal troubles and pressures. In such moments, a single word of encouragement or an inspiring thought can provide the strength to keep moving forward.

At the same time, those who are experiencing joy, success, and personal victories often seek meaningful ways to share their positivity with friends, loved ones, and communities. A thoughtful quote can serve both as a personal reminder and as a tool to motivate others not to lose hope, reminding them that tomorrow holds new possibilities.

This project aims to provide a simple yet powerful platform that delivers inspiring quotesâ€”whether to uplift someone in a difficult moment or to amplify joy and success stories that inspire others.
