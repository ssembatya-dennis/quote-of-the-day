## 3. Data Structure

The quotes will be stored in a simple and flexible data structure that can be easily managed within JavaScript.  
For the MVP, an **array of objects** is the most suitable choice because it:

- Allows us to store multiple quotes in a single collection.
- Provides an intuitive way to represent each quote with its text and author.
- Can be easily extended in the future to include additional properties such as category, tags, or source.
- Works seamlessly with JavaScript methods for random selection, searching, and filtering.

### Example Structure

```javascript
const quotes = [
  {
    id: 1,
    text: "The best way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.",
    author: "Walt Disney",
    category: "Motivation",
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    text: "In the middle of every difficulty lies opportunity.",
    author: "Albert Einstein",
    category: "Inspiration",
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    text: "Happiness is not something ready-made. It comes from your own actions.",
    author: "Dalai Lama",
    category: "Happiness",
  },
];
```
