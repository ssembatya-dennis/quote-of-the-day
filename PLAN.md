# Project Plan

## Introduction

This document outlines the structured plan for the development of **["Quote of the Day"]** web page.  
The purpose of this plan is to provide a clear roadmap from idea conception to implementation, ensuring that the project is built with clarity, scalability, and user experience in mind.

By documenting the problem, defining the minimum viable product (MVP), and considering both immediate and future requirements, this plan will serve as a guide for development, collaboration, and decision-making throughout the project lifecycle.

## 1. Problem Statement

Life presents different moods and challenges each day.  
Some individuals wake up struggling to find the energy to face the day, while others feel weighed down by personal troubles and pressures. In such moments, a single word of encouragement or an inspiring thought can provide the strength to keep moving forward.

At the same time, those who are experiencing joy, success, and personal victories often seek meaningful ways to share their positivity with friends, loved ones, and communities. A thoughtful quote can serve both as a personal reminder and as a tool to motivate others not to lose hope, reminding them that tomorrow holds new possibilities.

This project aims to provide a simple yet powerful platform that delivers inspiring quotes—whether to uplift someone in a difficult moment or to amplify joy and success stories that inspire others.

## 2. Core Features (MVP)

The "Quote of the Day" web application focuses on simplicity and inspiration.  
At its core, the MVP will deliver a seamless experience that allows users to view and interact with inspiring quotes in a minimal, polished interface.

### Must-Have Features

- **Quote Banner**: A prominent section of the page displays an inspiring quote along with its author.
- **Random Quote on Page Load**: Each time the page is refreshed, a randomly selected quote is displayed as the "Quote of the Day."
- **New Quote Button**: Users can click a button to instantly fetch and display a new, randomly selected quote.

### Nice-to-Have Features (Future Enhancements)

- **Download Quote**: An option to download the current quote (e.g., as an image or text file) for personal use or sharing.
- **Theme Customization**: A settings modal where users can switch between themes (e.g., light/dark mode) for a personalized experience.
- **Categories & Filters**: Ability to browse quotes by specific categories (e.g., motivation, happiness, success) or filter by author.
- **Search Functionality**: A search bar to quickly find quotes by keyword or author name.

The MVP ensures that the essential goal—delivering inspiration with minimal friction—is achieved first, while leaving space for richer personalization and interactivity in future iterations.

## 3. Data Structure

The quotes will be stored in a simple and flexible data structure that can be easily managed within JavaScript.  
For the MVP, an **array of objects** is the most suitable choice because it:

- Allows us to store multiple quotes in a single collection.
- Provides an intuitive way to represent each quote with its text and author.
- Can be easily extended in the future to include additional properties such as category, tags, or source.
- Works seamlessly with JavaScript methods for random selection, searching, and filtering.

### Example Structure

```javascript
const quotes = [
  {
    id: 1,
    text: "The best way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.",
    author: "Walt Disney",
    category: "Motivation",
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    text: "In the middle of every difficulty lies opportunity.",
    author: "Albert Einstein",
    category: "Inspiration",
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    text: "Happiness is not something ready-made. It comes from your own actions.",
    author: "Dalai Lama",
    category: "Happiness",
  },
];
```
